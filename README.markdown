# dans dotfiles

```
git clone git@github.com:dnl/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
~/.dotfiles/scripts/install.sh 
```

My understanding of bash is limited, my understanding of what is a very bad idea is even less so, but these are my tools.

PS. don't actually run ~/.dotfiles/scripts/install.sh that sounds like a terrible idea.
